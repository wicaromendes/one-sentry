# OneSentry

OneSentry is a tool that facilitates the development of Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the Node application when file changes in the directory are detected. It aims to enhance productivity and streamline the development process by eliminating the need for manual application restarts.

## Features

- Automatic restart: OneSentry monitors the directory for any file changes and automatically restarts the Node.js application, ensuring that the latest code changes take effect without manual intervention.
- Enhanced development workflow: With OneSentry, developers can focus on writing code and experimenting with different functionalities, knowing that the application will be automatically restarted whenever a file is modified.
- File change detection: OneSentry uses advanced file monitoring techniques to track modifications in the project directory, including additions, deletions, and modifications.
- Customizable configuration: OneSentry allows users to customize the monitoring behavior by specifying file extensions to include or exclude from the restart process, enabling fine-grained control over the application reloads.
